	abstract = "An automotive supply chain includes a range of activities from
              the concept of the product to its final transfer to a customer
              and subsequent vehicle maintenance. The three distinct stages of
              this chain are production, sales, and maintenance. In many
              countries, automobile records are not available to the public and
              anyone who has access to the central database or government
              systems can tamper with these records. In addition, used vehicle
              maintenance and transfer histories remain unavailable or
              inaccessible. These issues can be overcome by incorporating
              state-of-the-art blockchain technology into automotive supply
              chain management. Blockchain technology uses a chain of blocks
              for distributed transfer and storage of information, creating a
              decentralized data register that makes records of any digital
              asset tamper-proof and transparent. In this paper, we implement a
              permissioned blockchain-based framework for secure and efficient
              supply chain management of the automobile industry. We employed
              Hyperledger Fabric; an enterprise-grade distributed ledger
              platform for developing solutions. In our solution, the
              blockchain is customized and private in order to ensure system
              security. We evaluated our system in terms of memory cost,
              monetary cost, and speed of execution. Our results demonstrate
              that only 346 MB of extra memory space is required for storing
              the automotive data of 1 million users, thus rendering the memory
              cost negligible. The monetary cost is insignificant as all open
              source blockchain resources are employed, and the speed of record
              update is also fast. Our results also show that the
              decentralization of the automotive supply chain using blockchain
              can implement system security with minor modifications in the
              established configuration of the web application database.",

               service and quality which further enables the organizations to
               be a leader in their industry sector. This research study
               analyzes the challenges faced by the automotive industry in its
               supply chain operations. Further, the traceability issues and
               waiting time at different nodes of the supply chain are
               considered to be priority issues that affect the overall supply
               chain efficiency in the automotive supply chain. After studying
               the existing blockchain architectures and their implementation
               methodology, this study proposes a new blockchain-based
               architecture to improve traceability and reduce waiting time for
               the automotive supply chain. A hyper ledger fabric-based
               blockchain architecture is developed to track the ownership
               transfers in inbound and outbound logistics. The simulation
               results of the proposed hyper ledger fabric-based blockchain
               architecture show that there is an improvement in the
               traceability of items at different nodes of the supply chain
               that enhances the Inventory Quality Ratio (IQR) and the mean
               waiting time is reduced at the factory, wholesaler, and
               retailer, which thereby improves the overall supply chain
               efficiency. The blockchain embedded supply chain is more capable
               to eliminate the risks and uncertainties associated with the
               automotive supply chain. The benefits of adopting blockchain
               technology in the automotive supply chain are also described.
               The developed blockchain-based framework is capable to get more
               visibility into goods movement and inventory status in
               automotive supply chains.",

               ignorance of information about the source of the products. This
               article presents a new SC model with Blockchain. To do this, we
               carried out a comparison between the traditional supply chain
               and the new chain with the Blockchain in order to designate a
               model that meets our needs. This BKC method is a new technology
               that offers effective and confident solutions in businesses.
               This new model reinforces the reliability of the system based on
               transparency and traceability in all chain operations, assets
               and financial means and removes many of the disadvantages of the
               traditional supply chain. In addition, the Blockchain
               coordinates all transactions and multi-agents in the SC",
